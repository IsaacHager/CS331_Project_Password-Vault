# CS331_Project_Password-Vault
Group repository for CS331 project to implement a simple password vault.

## Project Desc.
*Temporary inclusion for convenience

### Description of Files

  UserLoginUI.java - Simple Java command line implementation of an interface to allow users to 
    add passwords to database and 'login'.
    
  PasswordManager.java - Provides functionality for encrypting and adding passwords to the database,
    verifying passwords, etc.
    
  PasswordDatabase.java - Contains an array of users and functionality to write and read stored data
    to a file.

### Project Overview

In this project, students will complete a project to apply computer security concepts
learned in class. Projects will be chosen by students from the list of projects provided or
can come up with their own project ideas. The project will focus on implementing
fundamental security concepts such as the CIA triad, authentication, access control,
cryptography, and assurance.

  Each project should have the following phases:
    - Design: Students prepare a project plan including objectives, scope, and
            methodology.
    - Implementation: Students develop a working demo, or tool.
    - Documentation: Students write a short report describing design, methods, results,
            and lessons learned.
    - Presentation: Students present their work to the class in the final weeks.

### Suggested Project Ideas
  - Authentication Using Password and Secret Questions
      Description: Build a login system that uses both password and secret questions.
      Concepts: Authentication, Availability.
  - **Simple Password Vault**
      **Description: Develop a password manager that stores passwords in an encoded
        form (e.g., basic hashing or reversible encoding).
      Concepts: Authentication, Confidentiality, Secure storage.**
  - Caesar Cipher
      Description: Build a program that implements Caesar cipher and allows users to try
        brute-force attacks to break them.
      Concepts: Confidentiality, Cryptanalysis basics.
  - Secure Messaging with Caesar Cipher
      Description: Implement a messaging system where users can send/receive
        messages encrypted with Caesar cipher. Add an option to “crack” it.
      Concepts: Confidentiality, Basic crypto.
  - Integrity Checker for Files
      Description: Write a tool that computes and verifies simple checksums (e.g., sum of
        ASCII codes). Detects if a file is altered.
      Concepts: Integrity, Assurance.
  - Fault Injection for Assurance
      Description: Simulate errors (wrong password attempts, corrupt files) and see how
        the system responds. For example, account lockouts after 3 failed attempts.
      Concepts: Assurance, Resilience, Availability.
  - Simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      Description: Implement a system where different users (admin, editor, viewer) have
        different rights over resources.
      Concepts: Access control.
  - Multi-Factor Authentication Demo
      Description: Implement a basic system where login requires both a password and a
        one-time code (simulated).
      Concepts: Authentication and resilience
  - RSA Algorithm Implementation
      Description: Implement RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption.
      Concepts: public-key cryptography and confidentiality.
